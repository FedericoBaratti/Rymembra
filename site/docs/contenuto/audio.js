Batches of 64 (`sonora::LOTTO`) on 3 threads with a 25 s deadline per track; outcomes `ok`, `illeggibile`, `muto`, `corto`; failures retried after 30 days. Once at least 50 tracks are measured, a normalization scale (`impronta_scala`) is computed. Fingerprints feed [Autoplay](#autoplay) and the weekly collections.",

Results go to `track_intensita`; the gain is derived when read (`−18 − LUFS`), so changing the target never needs a new measurement. Album values: duration-weighted mean of energy, peak = maximum.",
