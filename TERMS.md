# Rymembra terms of use

Last updated: 30 October 2026.

Rymembra is a free program, distributed under the MIT license. This document is
not the contract between you and me — that's `LICENSE`, and it says the program
is given «as is». This document is about something different and more concrete:
**what you can do with the music Rymembra gets for you**, because those terms
aren't set by me and I can't waive them on your behalf.

It's worth reading once. It's short.

---

## 1. The program is yours, the music isn't

Rymembra's code is MIT: do what you like with it.

The music you download through Rymembra is **not covered by that license**. Every
track comes from a catalog, and carries with it the conditions that catalog
and that artist put on it. Rymembra records each track's license next to the track
itself, and shows it on the «Now playing» screen and in «Explore», precisely so
this distinction doesn't get lost.

The normal case is simple: what you download you can listen to, keep, put on
your phone, burn to a CD for yourself. The conditions below are about
**redistributing** and **making money**.

---

## 2. The non-commercial constraint, which applies to you too

Two of the sources Rymembra uses carry a *non commercial* clause, and it isn't a
formality.

### Live Music Archive (archive.org/details/etree)

The collection's terms say that access to and any further distribution of the
material must be «**strictly noncommercial**». The artists there gave permission
to record and trade their concerts on that condition, and on no other.

In practice, for what you download from there:

- you may listen to it, copy it for yourself, share it with someone without
  asking for money;
- you may **not** sell it, nor put it inside something you sell, nor use it for
  advertising, nor monetize it in any form;
- you may **not** upload it to a platform that puts advertising on top of it.

### Jamendo (once it's enabled)

The *Jamendo API Terms of Use* define «commercial use» as «any monetary
compensation, including any revenue arising from affiliation programs or
advertising». From their API you **listen**: the terms explicitly forbid caching
the content or offering offline access to it, and Rymembra does neither. The
Jamendo module sits behind a feature that can be switched off for exactly this
reason.

### And for Rymembra itself

It's the reason **Rymembra is and stays free**. A paid version would violate those
clauses. Donations are accepted as support for the program's development, not as
payment for the music — no donation unlocks content, no track sits behind a
payment.

---

## 3. What Rymembra refuses to do, and why

Some things a program like this *could* do, and that Rymembra does not:

- **It doesn't download from YouTube.** Their *API Developer Policies*
  § III.E.1.a forbid it; § III.I.7 forbids separating the audio from the video;
  § III.I.9 forbids playing it from a player that isn't visible. A music player
  with a library is precisely what those rules rule out.
- **It doesn't scrape Spotify.** No private endpoints, no reconstructed tokens,
  no one else's client id. The only Spotify thing it reads is the export Spotify
  hands **you** on request, which is yours by right of data portability.
- **It doesn't download what the license doesn't allow.** The check happens
  before any network request: a track marked listen-only isn't even asked for.
  If a catalog says «you listen and you don't carry it away», Rymembra doesn't
  test whether the server would let it.
- **It doesn't circumvent protection measures.** No DRM is touched, in any form.

If you find a way to make Rymembra do one of these things, that's a defect. Report
it.

## 3-bis. Lyrics, and what LRCLIB is

Song lyrics are protected works, like the songs. Rymembra takes three routes to
them, and none of the three is «we have them under license»:

1. **What's already in your files** — an `.lrc` next to the track, or the tag
   inside the file. It's yours, and it's the first source looked at.
2. **LRCLIB**, a public and free catalog fed by the people who use it. It has
   an open API, made for music players: Rymembra queries it the way a browser
   queries a site, with no keys, no page scraping and no circumventing anything.
3. **What you sync yourself**, kept in Rymembra's library (and, if you ask, in
   an `.lrc` beside the track).

The part usually left unsaid, and said here: LRCLIB **is not a distributor with
sub-publishing contracts**. It's a database built by the community. Rymembra
breaks no rule by reading it, and that doesn't make the lyrics that come out of
it «licensed». Whoever hosts that catalog answers takedown requests from
rights holders; Rymembra redistributes nothing, keeps no copies elsewhere and does
not upload them into your backup.

Musixmatch, Genius, AZLyrics, LyricFind and the Chinese catalogs stay out, and
not out of laziness: either they want a license a local player doesn't have, or
they can only be read by scraping a page written for a browser. The project's CI
verifies on every change that none of those names has crept back into the code —
the same rule that keeps the downloader tools out.

### If you choose to give back

After syncing a lyric by hand you can send it to LRCLIB. It's a button, pressed
one at a time, and the fourth route — «somebody else's lyrics» — doesn't exist:
**only** what you synced yourself gets published, never what was in a file's tag
and never what has just arrived from the catalog.

It's worth saying plainly what you're doing when you press it. A song's lyric
stays the rights holder's even when you were the one who put the timings in:
what you're sharing are the **timings**, and the timings travel with the words
because separated they're no use to anyone. If you neither wrote those words nor
have the right to distribute them, sending them to a public catalog is your
decision and not one Rymembra takes for you — and that's the reason there's no way
for it to happen without your having decided it.

What goes to LRCLIB goes there under LRCLIB's license, not Rymembra's: the
catalog hosts it and answers for what it hosts. Rymembra keeps no copy, doesn't
resell it and doesn't put it back into circulation elsewhere. Your lyric stays
in your library — and an `.lrc` you have stays on your disk, identical —
whether you press that button or not.

## 3-ter. Listening together

From 3.1 Rymembra can play the same music on several PCs of the same network
at once («Listen together»). Two things follow from that, and both are about
the music, not the program.

- **The music of the session travels between its PCs, while it plays.** The
  host's files go to the PCs that follow, and the tracks a member adds go to
  the others through the host. It is the same as playing your music on a second
  set of speakers in another room of your home or office: the tracks are
  streamed to PCs you paired, for the length of the session, and nothing is
  left on their disks. It is not a way to
  hand your library to someone, and Rymembra does not let a member keep what
  it heard.
- **Catalog tracks are never passed on.** A track from the Internet Archive or
  Audius in a session queue is fetched from the catalog by **each** PC, under
  that catalog's terms (§ 2), and never relayed from one PC to another. The
  non-commercial clauses of § 2 bind everyone listening, not only the host.

Playing music for an audience — in a shop, a bar, an event — can be a public
performance that needs a license of its own, depending on where you are.
Listening together with colleagues or family does not change what you are
allowed to do with the music, and Rymembra cannot give you that license.

## 4. What's left to buy

When no free catalog has a track, Rymembra doesn't retry forever and doesn't
pretend it's a fault: it puts it in «To buy», with links to Bandcamp, Qobuz and
Discogs.

I earn nothing from those links. They aren't affiliate links, there's no
tracking, and the address is built by the program from a closed list of three
domains — precisely so nothing else can be slipped in.

---

## 5. Your library is yours

Rymembra works on files that sit on your disk — or, from 3.2, in a cloud
folder of yours that you chose to add — and on an SQLite database that sits in
your data folder. There's no Rymembra server, there's no Rymembra account,
there's nothing I can switch off. A cloud folder is read with your own account
at that service, under that service's terms, and Rymembra only ever reads it.

For OneDrive, Google Drive and Dropbox — and for the Google Drive backup —
there is one more thing that is yours: the app through which Rymembra reaches
the service. Rymembra ships none of its own. You register it with Microsoft,
Google or Dropbox under your own developer account, you operate it, and you do
so under that platform's developer terms, which are between you and the
platform. I don't see that app, its ID or its quota, and I can't switch it
off.

**Rymembra does not modify your music files.** It opens them to read — to scan
them, to decode them, to measure them — and never to write. Up to 2.3.0 that
was not true, and this section used to say so: enrichment rewrote the tags in
your files, and a reorganizer moved them into `Artist/Album` folders. From
2.3.1 neither does. What Rymembra works out about a track lives in the library
database beside your own corrections, where a re-scan cannot silently undo it.

What it does write is a short list, and `PRIVACY.md` § 8 carries all of it: the
files Rymembra downloaded itself, the `.lrc` it saves beside a track if you
switch that on, the playlists, skins and profile archive you ask it to export,
and its own data folders. Nothing on that list is a file you already had.
When you upgrade from the previous version, the installer removes it and
Rymembra carries its data into its data folder on first start; your library
comes with you and nothing is overwritten.

One entry does reach a file you already had, and only when you press it: from
2.3.2 a track's menu offers **«Delete from disk»**, which sends the file to the
Recycle Bin and takes the library row with it — except on a network share, a
removable drive (a USB stick, an SD card) or wherever else Windows has no
Recycle Bin, or when Rymembra cannot tell where the file is: there the file is
deleted permanently, and only after a confirmation that says so. It asks first and never runs by itself, and
**«Remove from library»** beside it leaves the disk alone entirely.

A backup of what you care about remains a good idea all the same — that goes
for any program that reads your disk, this one included.

## 6. No warranty

As `LICENSE` says: the program is provided «as is», without warranty of any
kind. I'm not answerable for lost data, damaged files or full disks.

I'm not answerable either for what you do with the music you download. I show
you each track's conditions; respecting them is your business.

---

## 7. If something here is wrong

If you represent a catalog, a label or an artist and you believe Rymembra is
doing something it shouldn't, write. There's no formal procedure because there's
no company: there's a person, and the answer to a well-founded report is fixing
the code.
